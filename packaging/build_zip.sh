SGTM Automix $VERSION -- manual install
========================================

This is the no-installer copy, for anyone who would rather drag two files
into place than run an installer. If you would prefer the installer, grab
the .pkg from the releases page instead -- it does exactly the same thing.

Copy the plugin(s) you want into place:

    SGTM Automix.component  ->  ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/
    SGTM Automix.vst3       ->  ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/

Only one format is needed, not both -- AU for Logic/MainStage, VST3 for
Cubase/Nuendo/Reaper/etc. Create the destination folder first if it
doesn't already exist. These are your own user plug-in folders, so no
administrator password is needed.

That's the whole install. Restart your DAW, or trigger a plugin rescan, so
it picks up the new plugin.

Both plugins are signed with an Apple Developer ID and notarized by Apple,
with the notarization ticket stapled to each bundle -- so there is no
quarantine flag to clear, no Terminal command to run, and no Gatekeeper
prompt, even offline.

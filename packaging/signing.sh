# Shared Developer ID signing / notarization helpers for the SGTM Automix
# packaging scripts. Sourced by build_installer.sh and build_zip.sh --
# not meant to be run directly.
#
# Both scripts need the identical "check the bundles, sign them, get them
# notarized and stapled" sequence, so it lives here once. The notarization
# step is idempotent: if the bundles already carry a valid stapled ticket it
# does nothing, so running both scripts back to back costs one trip to
# Apple's notary service, not two.
#
# Credentials: none are stored here or anywhere else in the repo. Signing
# uses the Developer ID certificates in the login keychain, and notarization
# uses a notarytool keychain profile (default name: "notarytool") created
# once with:
#
#     xcrun notarytool store-credentials notarytool \
#         --apple-id <apple-id> --team-id <team-id> --password <app-specific-password>
#
# See the "Code signing" section of BUILDING.md.
#
# PACE (AAX) signing: PACE's tools and documentation are confidential under
# the PACE license agreement, and this repo is public. Never commit wraptool,
# PACE docs, or iLok/account identifiers here -- keep them in packaging/pace/
# (gitignored) or outside the repo, and read credentials from the environment
# or keychain, as for notarization above.

# Overridable so a fork can sign with its own identities without editing
# the scripts. Defaults are SGTM's (Team ID ZVP9U3LWAJ).
